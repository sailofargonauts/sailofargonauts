### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is sailof argo

I'm a physics student in one of university in Indonesia. This is my learning github account. Curently I'm joining program about machine learning so I thought it would be great if I can use github for future collaboration with my teammates. So, hopefully if you want someone to learn together about machine learning or about github, feel free to ask me. And for your information, I'm a newbie in this field :).

See ya!
